pulsar-polarization-sims
========================

Scripts for simulationing the effects of polarization purity in pulsar timing

Required Software:

* psrchive (http://psrchive.sourceforge.net/), follow http://psrchive.sourceforge.net/third/install.shtml

todo:

* for MTM, check for a missing solution for a simulated profile, generate a new profile and try again (try/except)
* perform MTM first such that all remaining methods use the same profiles
